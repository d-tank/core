<p>dtank is a rapidly deployable, distributed, fault-tolerant, software-defined storage system.</p>

<h3>
<a id="Qu'est-ce que Dtank?" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's a Dtank?</h3>

<p>Dtank is an implementation of MooseFS running in Docker containers, it leverages etcd and confd for easy management, communication, and metric retrieval for all the moving parts.  Dtank's goal is to make it easy for you to combine spare disk space from workstations and servers running Mac OS X / BSD, Linux, or Windows into a centralised pool of storage space that's got inherent failover.

<h3>
<a id="uh...huh..." class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What kind of failover?</h3>

<p>By combining MooseFS's replication and data tiering with etcd/confd for on-the-fly changes to configuration, and painless rapid deployment in Docker, there's a lot of elasticity when it comes to designing - and changing - your data storage layout.</p>

<p>For a home user, two or three old computers running dtank are a much cheaper alternative to running a NAS appliance - when you need more storage, you simply add another drive and tell dtank about it.</p>

<p>For a business, dtank can scale-out over as many disks, servers, and datacenters as you like.</p>

<p>In both cases, the easily configurable replication and tiering aspects mean that your storage can be reshaped to facilitate a different purpose extremely easily.</p>

<h3>
<a id="How can I use it?" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I use it?</h3>

<p>Dtank is currently being written. As releases become available for testing, they'll be linked to on here both as source and as pullable docker machines.</p>
